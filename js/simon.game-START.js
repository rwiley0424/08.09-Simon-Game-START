// ALGORITHM..?
// grab all 4 buttoms in the simon container
// get em into an array of 4 elements(node list)


//a boolean to keep track of whether game is alrady// playing or not  cuz only want keydown to happen if game is not playing (false)

// array to keep track of random btns; do this by saving btn color

//an array to store sequence of randomly served buttons

//keep track of user button clicks to compare to sequence index


//get the h2 for providing feedback

// make each button clickable, to start just log the color which is the inof the button:

// check if this is the correct btn, does it line up w btnSequence
    
//user clicked correct btn
        //increment clicks with each user btn
        
        // if user has clicked through entire sequence correctly serve new btn:
        //play sound with button click
        
        //game over user clicked wrong button (not in sequence)
        
        // NEW GAME RESET
        
        //reset the sequence for a new game
        
        //toggle boolean so that 'keydown' starts new game


// GAME ON ! press any key to start game;
//  one of the 4 buttons flash.. this is user's cue to click the same button

// document lesten for key -- any key--and runs makes button flash when 
// any key is clicked -- flash consists of .5 sec delay before 
// rand btn vanishes then another .5 sec later, button reappears (opacity -- not display:none)

// start game by hitting any key once
// that generates a rand button but for next radn btn, user does not hit key
// all subsequent rand btns happend automatically

// 1.0 sec delay then rand btn vanishes
   
    //.6 sec later, button reappears
    
    // save the color of the served btn to the sequence arr:
  
    //'green', 'red','green'...etc.
    //user's turn to try to replicate sequence so reset clicks 


// make the random button play its 'color-coded sound'
